<div class="entry-content"><p>Last night, or more precisely, this early morning,
I had a strong feeling to write a letter to my boss to talk about my leaving again.<br/>
The thing is, I have talked with him on Monday, however, he insisted me to stay of course.<br/>
After a long talk, I compromised somehow and agreed to stay for one more year.<br/>
But then I found out that I&rsquo;m still not happy and so willing to leave for Shanghai.<br/>
Thus that is how the long letter below comes:</p>

<!-- more -->




<blockquote><p>Dear Prof. Chen,  </p><p>I am not good at talking with people face to face; after all I am a programmer with engineer character.  <br/>So it would be better for me to write this sincere long letter to you, sharing my real thoughts with you.  </p><p>Actually this &#8220;Leaving for Shanghai&#8221; idea did not just come up accidentally. In fact, the most important reason is me myself.   <br/>You know it is quite common for a young man at my age to think about life all the time.    <br/>I have been thinking about my life and my future for a long time.    <br/>Then I found out that my life is not here, not in Shenzhen, but in Shanghai.   <br/>Because nearly all of my friends are there, and also my relatives are all there, which means my life is there too,    <br/>let alone I always want to work and live in Shanghai since my childhood.   </p><p>However, what is more important: my heart has changed.   </p><p>Once a man&#8217;s heart has changed, it will not restore as old times any more.   <br/>One year ago, I decided to stay because I have always wanted to start my own business and I thought this could be the chance.   <br/>But after one year&#8217;s work, I gradually found out I am not the right entrepreneur guy.    <br/>I do not have such genes or characters to become an entrepreneur.    </p><p>After talking with you on Monday, I have been suffering and I cannot put my mind on current work.    <br/>That&#8217;s why I decided to write to you, to tell you all my thoughts, otherwise I cannot even get to sleep at night.   <br/>Yes, I agreed to stay for one more year.   <br/>But then I asked myself, how about one year later, what am I going to do, stay or leave?    <br/>Do I really want to stay?  Or is it just because I do not know how to say no?    <br/>(I have been a good guy to make others happy since I was a child. I do not like to upset or offend anybody)   <br/>Then my heart gave me the right answer. No matter what the company will be like, I will leave anyway.   <br/>Why?   <br/>Because of my heart.   <br/>I am not an entrepreneur any more. All I think about is to work for you, work for a boss, but not for myself, not for our company.   <br/>There is no point for me to stay here for one more year.    <br/>I do not have the passion to continue, while I am just a like ordinary dead man waiting for the paying day every month.   <br/>I believe you could understand this, it would be a waste of money, time, and energy for both of us if you insist to keep such a man here.   </p><p>I have made up my mind after I heard my heart&#8217;s calling.    <br/>I must follow my heart. This is not just a fancy excuse, but it is the truth, that I can feel it so strong from the bottom of my heart.    <br/>To be honest, I once thought about some other excuses to leave, but then I tell myself why not just telling you the truth.   <br/>It will benefit both of us if we can have such sincere communication.   </p><p>And there is one more thing, which is very important and really urgent for me right now.   <br/>Could you please ask Nansha Fok Ying Tung Graduate School to terminate my current intern contract as soon as possible.   <br/>As I mentioned before, I will leave for Shanghai. But you know &#8220;Hu Kou&#8221; is extremely important for Mainland Chinese.   <br/>This intern contract will affect my application for Shanghai Hu Kou if it does not terminate immediately.   </p><p>I have also learned a lot and experienced a lot during this year.    <br/>So I really want to say: &#8220;Thank you!&#8221;, for teaching and training me, for giving me courage and energy all the time.   <br/>We can have a little talk in your office when you are available.   </p><p>Thank you very much!   </p><p>Best,   <br/>Wang Heng</p></blockquote>


<p>Well, coincidently and what seems so funny, one year ago, I also wrote a long letter to tell him my decision, telling him why I decided to stay. <br/>
Below is the letter one year ago:</p>

<blockquote><p>Dear Prof. Chen,  <br/> <br/>After serious consideration, I decided to stay here for another year and would like to sign a contract of RA for 12 months.   <br/>  <br/>Frankly speaking, I have always wanted to be an entrepreneur but not for now actually.   <br/>I thought it would be better to work at a startup company for a few years first and learn everything from it, like which technologies they use, how to run a team, how to corporate with each other, how to communicate with the clients etc.   </p><p>The reason why I changed my  mind is I really thought this could be an opportunity. The opportunity is right there, why not seize it before it’s too late. There is always a big opportunity in the IT area every couple of years. This social media could really be that opportunity for these years. Another great thing is that everyone is talking about mobile developing and every big company is willing to introduce their own mobile phones, and also those big companies are too conservative to try new cool things. I believe all those factors make this opportunity to be a GREAT opportunity.    </p><p>There are also some people or small companies who have already started their social media business which are still not  smart or advanced enough. So I think we should just do it, do it early, and do it fast before it’s too late. Even if we cannot be the first, we can still be the best. As for what we should do next, I actually have some thoughts, but still not mature right now.  </p><p>But one thing is for sure, I believe, which is also what Caleb always said, we should do something that our group is really good at. Only in this way we can lead the whole industry and that is also why we can survive under such serious competition.   <br/>Below are some links I mentioned last time. Maybe they can give you some inspiration.  <br/> <br/> 1.       http://xunren.thuir.org/ 微博寻人 created by梁斌(@梁斌penny)  <br/> 2.       http://ask.weibo.com/trailer.html 微博知识社区 created by Sina Weibo  <br/> 3.       http://www.doodod.com/doodod/home  独到科技 created by Tsing Hua University  <br/>  <br/>Best Regards,   <br/>WANG Heng</p></blockquote>


<p>I would say &ldquo;C&#8217;est la vie&rdquo;. What a &ldquo;start with email, end with email&rdquo;.</p>
