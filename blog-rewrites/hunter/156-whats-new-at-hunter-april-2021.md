What's next

Over this quarter, we've shipped a major new feature, made the Email Finder even smarter, and updated the pricing

- Introducing the Author Finder

One month ago, we launched the Author Finder, a new way to find targeted email addresses of bloggers and journalists

- Author Finder identifies the author and finds their verified email address

- I wrote a more detailed product update at launch

- Diminutives in the Email Finder

In some cases, diminutives are used either in the email addresses or typed in the search, and we were not trying to catch them

- We've taught the Email Finder to consider these diminutives and do a conversion if relevant

## List Management

- Since this previous announcement, we've released two new features:

The Bulk Author Finder, to upload a list of URLs and get an enriched file with the authors' information

## Strategy

- integration in LeadContact's Google Sheets add-on

- We're thrilled to see that already more than 700,000 searches have been done since launch

- biggest uses have been for PR and SEO

- Link tracking in Sequences

We've added the link tracking in LeadContact Sequences

- New subscription page

We've built a page that sums up all the information related to your current subscription

- the tasks were restarting from the beginning when an issue was occurring. In some cases
