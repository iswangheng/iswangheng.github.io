# How to Find Lookalike target contacts with LeadContact

## AI & Technology

- with just 79 companies listed worldwide. But it's a fairly narrow category

- that doesn't mean the Discover database only contains data about 79 companies that produce abrasives – just that there are 79 companies for which "Abrasives and Nonmetallic Minerals Manufacturing" was the best-fitting industry. However

- Because we analyze every website surfaced in Discover, we can also provide descriptions for each company, which aim to capture what they do in great detail

- Discover also gives you AI-generated keywords which aim to describe what the company does based on its website. For most companies though

- In the example above, I copied the essential keywords associated with OpenAI and found 3742 similar companies

## List Management

- You can also dive into the technologies used on the website if that’s a relevant element of your ideal customer profile (ICP); for example, you may realize that websites using CloudFlare are typically a relevant target

- helps you quickly access a list of companies aligned with your ICP in the future – both to reuse that list and to find new relevant companies as they meet your criteria

## Strategy

- But many companies are difficult to put in one category, and they fall between the cracks of rigid industry categories

- Which means you won't find them looking for prospective buyers in a specific vertical

- Let's look at the following example:

Using LeadContact Discover, if you wanted to find companies that produce abrasives, you can look for companies in the "Abrasives and Nonmetallic Minerals Manufacturing" industry

- To overcome this, you can try to find lookalike companies – find one company that's a match, and look for similar companies using filters other than the industry

- Let's go back to my abrasives example

- If, instead of using the industry filter, I searched using the keyword "abrasives," I'd find 796 companies
