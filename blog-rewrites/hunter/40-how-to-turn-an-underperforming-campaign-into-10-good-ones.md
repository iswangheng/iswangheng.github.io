How To Turn an Underperforming Campaign Into 10 Good Ones
 Ziemek Bućko • Updated 25 April 2025
Enrich your prospective contact list
Review your prospective contact list and create subsegments
Improve your cold outreach campaigns copy
What’s next

- Sometimes, my email campaigns underperform

- certain that I must have messed up. I go into the Sequences editor and look at what I wrote when creating the sequence

- it’s usually because I aim to target a big segment with the same message. When my campaigns underperform

- Segmentation:

I take my list, 
I review what I know about the recipients, 
I find smaller groups of people within the list,
I break it down into smaller segments,
I create separate campaigns for these smaller segments, making slight tweaks to my copy

- Even if you upload nothing but an email address to potential customers, we’ll automatically enrich it (as long as we have the information in our database)

## List Management

- In fact, it’s usually the targeting, not the copy itself, that’s at fault

- Let me show you how I segment my audience and create more targeted messaging in a time-effective way

- Enrich your prospective contact list

Segmentation is unlocked by data, and the more datapoints you have, the more likely you are to find ones that help you create smaller lists

- Review your potential customer list and create subsegments

Having the data is one thing, but knowing how to act on it is another

- you need the ability to quickly understand the smaller segments hiding in your large list. To efficiently segment

- these people often share some responsibilities—including the ones that make them our target audience—but there are also significant differences. Their job titles include:

Editor
Content Editor
Marketing Manager
Content Writer
Head of Marketing

In practice

## Personalization & Value

- prospective contact data is typically characterized by high cardinality, which means that there are many different values for every variable

## Strategy

- It happens more often than I’d like to admit, and when it does, one of my first instincts is to review the copy

- But I usually find that my copy is solid, and while I could always make tweaks, there’s nothing that stands out as really bad

- You might think that this level of effort only pays off if your ticket size is high enough

- may have been true a couple of years ago, but I don’t think it’s true now

- mediocre engagement doesn’t get you mediocre results. In 2025

- If all you know about your recipients is their names and job titles, that doesn’t get you far
