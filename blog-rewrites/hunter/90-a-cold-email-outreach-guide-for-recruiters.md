- Send your email at the right time
Wrap up

Generic cold revenue teams campaignss that look like hundreds of other revenue teams campaigns messages won’t help recruiters acquire the best talent

- Candidates are more likely to ignore such messages and respond to an email that stands out and makes a memorable first impression

- So, how can you make your email personalized and informative enough to grab the attention of a target contact who doesn’t know anything about your organization

- Respect the candidate’s time

You may want to enrich your cold revenue teams campaigns with a lot of extra information to describe your company in detail, but remember that recipients might not have enough time to read such an essay

- Your main goal here is to motivate a candidate to read your message and consider your offer

## Deliverability & Spam

- Longer subject lines may get clipped, especially if recipients view their inboxes on smartphones, so it’s vital to make your copy short yet meaningful and attention-grabbing

## Email Writing

- Make your subject line concise and meaningful

- We recommend you limit your subject line’s length to 36-50 characters

## List Management

- We’ve compiled a list of tips from professional recruiters that will help you attract passive candidates

## Personalization & Value

- Respecting the candidate’s time and making recipients feel special and valued is crucial

## Strategy

- Remember that you’re reaching out to a real person

- Work on the content of your message

- Remember that you’re reaching out to a real person


Time is a non-renewable resource so remember that you’re trying to contact a real person with their own lives and experiences

- For instance, it may require frequent business trips, so it won’t make sense to contact a person who wants to work from home

- Learn the candidate’s experience

Try to learn more about your candidate’s professional experience by going beyond their LinkedIn profile

- For example, content writers publish their articles on Medium, web designers post their portfolios on Behance, developers showcase their past projects on GitHub, etc
