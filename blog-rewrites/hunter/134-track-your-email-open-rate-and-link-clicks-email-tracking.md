Email tracking allows you to collect additional information about the performance of your communications

- the metrics you can track aside from your reply rate include:

Open rate – how many times your communications are opened,
Link clicks – how often links in your communications are clicked. In the context of cold business development campaigns

- You wouldn’t be able to analyze either of these metrics when sending regular messages without tracking mechanisms implemented

## Strategy

- can artificially inflate your open rate

- Getting your message forwarded is usually a good thing, but not if you want to measure specifically how many times the initial recipient opened the message
