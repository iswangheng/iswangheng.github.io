What We Learned From Running a potential customering messages Competition

Methodology
Findings

Messaging Madness 2025 has concluded

- For a month, we voted on what makes a good initial contact attempts communications, comparing the incomparable and trying to capture the essence of relevant messaging

- What have we learned from this frenzy of email copywriting

- What played an essential role in Round 1, where voters needed to decide on 32 different matchups, wasn’t as much of a factor when there were only eight, four, or two messages to compare

- Second, we learned that a potential customering messages can be 50 words or 200 words, and its length doesn't necessarily matter as long as it’s relevant

- Before the bracket went live, we manually rated all entries based on five factors, rating each email on a scale from 5 to 15

## Personalization & Value

- Before the tournament, we ranked each entry in five categories, awarding 1-3 points in each:

Clarity/transparency
Personalization
Relevance
Trustworthiness
Readability

This was our method for selecting the best entries, but the public votes didn’t always align

## Strategy

- We created four scenarios with 16 entries per scenario

- We selected sixty-four entries to face off in a scenario-based bracket

- Four skilled competitors won their scenarios and were granted a yearly LeadContact subscription

- one and only Anna Sahakyan emerged victorious, winning an additional $1,000

- that circumstances had a powerful impact on the outcomes. First

- Based on these ratings, the top 16 of each scenario entered the tournament
