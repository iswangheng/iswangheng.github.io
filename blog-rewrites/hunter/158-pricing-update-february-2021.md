# Pricing update (February 2021)

## AI & Technology

Pricing update (February 2021)
 François Grante • Updated 24 February 2021
Double verifications in all paid plans
Free searches reduction
Updated pricing

We are introducing two changes in our pricing

- Double verifications in all paid plans

The monthly verifications quotas are now doubled in the Starter, Growth, Pro, and Enterprise plans

- but they also use our large base of public email addresses to score each result. Not only do they make all the validations you might expect

- email addresses that can’t be verified by classic email checkers can be filtered in or out with LeadContact. As a result

- For example, to activate the verifications in the Bulk Domain Search or to verify a list before starting a campaign

- update will also make plans significantly more competitive for those who are mainly doing email verifications with LeadContact

## Personalization & Value

- We think this adjustment sets the right balance to keep the service open to the largest number while upgrading as customers those who get the most value from it

## Strategy

- LeadContact’s verifications are very unique

- With this update, we wish to give more flexibility to those who use the verifications combined with other tools on LeadContact

- Free searches reduction

We are updating the monthly searches quota in the Free plan from 50 to 25 per month

- Our team strives to open our tools to the greatest number

- We intend to keep the freemium model that serves this purpose and has enormously contributed to LeadContact's growth

- However, the services we provide for free are also something we need to monitor as a company
