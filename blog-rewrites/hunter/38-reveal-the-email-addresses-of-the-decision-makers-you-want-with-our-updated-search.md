- Our May 2025 update makes it easier to find the decision makers you want before using a Search Credit to reveal their email address

- TL;DR

Historically, Domain Search in LeadContact provided 10 messages per Search Credit, but you had minimal visibility into the department or role associated with the contacts

- update helps you:

View decision makers before spending credits
Filter by department and title
Import companies manually or via CSV
Reveal only the email addresses you want

Cold contact attempts is highly effective when targeting your contacts and personalizing contact attempts

- To better enable that, we've updated Domain Search to emphasize departments and decision makers

- In both scenarios, we’ll:

Find prospective contacts at Paddle
Identify the relevant decision makers 
Reveal their email address
How to use this in Domain Search

We want to promote research to Paddle’s Marketing prospective contactership

## List Management

- was great for bulk business development campaigns, but as we've learned, it's not nearly as effective as targeted business development campaigns

- New ways to import companies

There’s also a bonus update: you can now manually add companies in Company Lists via CSV upload or individually within a list

## Strategy

- will enable you to spend credits more wisely and help you pinpoint your engagement to the right team and decision maker

- Log in to LeadContact or create your free account to see how far your Search Credits now go

- How to use the decision maker update

Because this update impacts two key parts of LeadContact, let’s walk through how we would find specific decision makers from two different departments at SaaS billing company, Paddle

- Identify their Marketing decision makers

In the results, enter “Marketing” into the “Job Title” filter to focus on Marketers

- Once you are happy with the potential customers, select the button next to each name and then “Save to potential customers

- ”

You’ll spend one Search Credit per business development lead saved
