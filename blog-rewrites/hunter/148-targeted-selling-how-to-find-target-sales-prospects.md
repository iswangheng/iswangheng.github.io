What Is Targeted Selling

- you need a business development strategy that drills down to key buyers and targets them with super-personalized business development and account based marketing materials to win them over. So

- article will teach you how to use business development targeting to win high-ticket accounts, plus real-life examples you can mirror today

- Targeted selling, also known as Target Account Selling (TAS), is a B2B business development process that consists of developing hyper customized nurturing, engaging, and long-term relationships with decision-makers within companies you’ve identified as highly qualified targets

- A more appropriate term for “best-fit customer” here is Ideal Customer Profile (ICP)
