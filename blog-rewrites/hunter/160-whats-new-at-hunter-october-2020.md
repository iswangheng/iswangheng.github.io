- Over the last quarter, we’ve launched multiple updates concerning the Email Verifier, the Email Finder, and launched a new product

- Here are all the main changes we’ve introduced and what we plan for the end of 2020

- Updated verification statuses

When we built the Email Verifier, it could initially return only 3 possible results: Valid, Invalid, and Risky

- and you can use it safely. Here are the new verification statuses:

Valid: the email address exists

- Invalid: the email address doesn’t exist and shouldn’t be used

## Strategy

- 0
Redesigned usage page
More customer support
What’s next

- this classification was sometimes lacking clarity. While working for most

- category “Risky” was covering different realities

- if the server blocks LeadContact or if the verification times out. For example

- We are excited to announce new improvements that are making it significantly more powerful

- These verifications are now systematic
