Email Finder improvements
Team collaboration
More Sequences improvements

These past few months, we've improved the Email Finder, made team collaboration smoother, and added cool options to Sequences (our cold contact attempts tool)

- Email Finder improvements

Since our inception, the Email Finder has been key to our success and the success of our clients

- We updated our crawler to find even more public communications (as a reminder, we source all the communications we find on the open web)

- we’ve increased the size of our email database by 13%;
We also tweaked our input algorithm to make sure we can return an email even if the parameters entered in the Email Finder are not 100% perfect or if they include special characters/emojis. In the last 6 months

- change should have the most impact for those of you using the Email Finder API;
Finally, we reworked our data algorithm to find more hard-to-find communications;

All-in-all, our internal tests indicated that we're now able to find +5% more valid communications

- Share your magic link in Slack or via email
