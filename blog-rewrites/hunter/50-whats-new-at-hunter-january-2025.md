# What’s new at LeadContact? (January 2025)

## AI & Technology

- We now have 20 million profiles to find via Discover, the Email Finder, or the Domain Search

- Give it a try—think of companies you couldn’t contact before due to a lack of verified email addresses, or jump into Discover to find hundreds of thousands of companies and millions of people profiles to choose from

- Choose from filters like “Country”, “Industry”, and “Position” to quickly spot pockets of opportunity to tailor your lists in ways you’ve yet to see

- LeadContact’s Enrichment API

Segmentation is impossible if you only know your potential customers’ names and email addresses

- and we give you ~100 data points we have on the associated profile. You can now use LeadContact’s Enrichment API in three modes:

Contact enrichment: You provide an email address

- and we give you everything we know about the associated profile and company. Combined enrichment: You provide an email address

- Visit or create a potential customers list in LeadContact, and at the top of the page, you’ll now see three panels that do the analytical heavy lifting for you

## Strategy

- Our B2B database doubled in size

I am only slightly exaggerating here—compared to early December 2024, you can now find 90% more B2B profiles in LeadContact

- To put this in context:

facebook

- com: We've added 51 C-level profiles

- com: We've added 101 profiles ranging from C-level to department managers
