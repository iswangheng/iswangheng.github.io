- Want to learn how to take full advantage of LinkedIn InMail for engagement

- Read on for InMail best practices and a step-by-step guide

- LinkedIn InMail messages allow you to contact people you’re not already connected to on the platform, which makes cold contact attempts much more manageable

## Deliverability & Spam

- If you open your inbox and give it a scroll, you’ll likely see both types of messages

## List Management

- If (and this is a big if) the message is targeted and impossible to ignore

## Strategy

- you might just get lost in the noise. Otherwise

- Because everything happens on LinkedIn, you’re also reaching people at a place they come to for networking

- it looks like any other LinkedIn message you might receive. Beyond that

- These will show up with a “Sponsored” label and are set up more like LinkedIn ads than a 1-to-1 message

- Here’s how many monthly credits you get for each account type:

Premium Career: 5 credits
Premium Business: 15 credits
revenue teams Navigator Core: 50 credits
Recruiter Lite: 30 credits
