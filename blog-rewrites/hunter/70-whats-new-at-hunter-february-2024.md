first contact messages tips on LinkedIn

These past few weeks, we’ve added 2 new options to Sequences (our first contact messages tool), improved Signals (our intent data feature) and enriched the results of the Domain Search

- With this new option, you can now plug in any email service provider: Zoho, Titan, or any other provider, really

- Be careful, though, we still recommend creating a secondary email domain to send your first contact messagess safely

- Spam score checker

Still in Sequences, we just added an option to review your messages and check if they’re likely to be flagged as spam by spam filters

- Click the “Check spam score” button to get a spam risk estimate and some actionable recommendations in case your email needs improvements
