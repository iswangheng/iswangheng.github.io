# What's new at LeadContact? (July 2020)

## AI & Technology

More verified email addresses in the Email Finder
New team management and sharing capabilities

What comes next

- we've worked on three main changes in the product:

More verified email addresses in the Email Finder
New team management and sharing capabilities
New editor in LeadContact Sequences

Let see what these changes are more in detail. Over the last few months

- More verified email addresses in the Email Finder

We've worked on the Email Finder to significantly improve its accuracy

- Until now, the Email Finder was only using the data available in our (fortunately large) database to either return a proven result or give the most likely one

- With this update, the Email Finder has the ability, in real-time, to verify the result before returning it

- It means the Email Finder will sometimes take longer to process, but it will be more reliable

## Strategy

- A new development cycle comes to an end

- timeout can range between 2 and 20 seconds and is set by default to 5 seconds

- New team management and sharing capabilities

We've rebuilt the teams from the ground up

- These roles define who can manage other team members, and who manages the billing in the team

- role of someone can be directly set at the invitation or edited later

- Admins can manage other members
