How to Find Email Addresses of Blog Article Authors
 Ziemek Bućko • Updated 06 June 2024
Step 1: Prepare your list of articles and the necessary API access

- Step 2: Crawl the articles
Step 3: Analyze the content using AI
Step 4: Find email addresses using the LeadContact API
Wrapping up

There are several use cases for contacting authors of blog articles at scale

- Using LeadContact, it’s easy to find anyone’s email address with the Email Finder or the Domain Search

- First, you need to find the name of the author of each article on your list, and then you need to find their email address

- problem can now be addressed using AI to analyze the content of articles on your list—artificial intelligence is great at analyzing large bodies of text

- I’ll briefly present a workflow to automatically find email addresses of blog authors from a list of article URLs. In this article

## List Management

- However, the process is time-consuming if you only have a list of URLs

- Step 1: Prepare your list of articles and the necessary API access

- Then, paste a list of URLs in column A

- you can automatically save the content of the articles from your list in a new sheet. Step 2: Crawl the articles

Using the “Crawl URLs” function in the custom menu

## Strategy

- For example, as a marketer building links to your website, you may want to ask about inserting a contextual link, or pitch a topic they could cover in their next blog post

- We used to offer a tool called the Author Finder that automated the process of finding the right address

- we discontinued the service because we couldn’t provide satisfactory results. However

- More specifically, it was challenging to find the author's name in an automated way

- But the tech landscape has recently changed

- If this sounds intimidating, don't worry–if you already have a LeadContact account, setting this up shouldn't take long
