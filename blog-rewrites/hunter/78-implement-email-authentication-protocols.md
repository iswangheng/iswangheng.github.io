How SPF, DKIM, and DMARC boost target contacting messages email deliverability
How to implement SPF, DKIM, and DMARC
Next steps

As of 2023, three email authentication protocols are commonly adapted and used together:

SPF,
DKIM, and
DMARC

- If you send cold engagements, consider implementing each of these three authentication protocols on the domain you’re using to send them

- They are bound to improve the inbox placement of your campaigns, resulting in fewer bounced communications

- And unless your first contact messages setup is unusual, implementing SPF, DKIM, and DMARC shouldn’t take more than 30 minutes

- How SPF, DKIM, and DMARC boost first contact messages inbox placement

SPF, DKIM, and DMARC use various methods to validate that you were authorized to send an email from your server and your domain and that the message was not altered during the sending process

## Deliverability & Spam

- Implement them for better email performance

- And trust is critical for the probability of your messages landing in the recipient’s inbox

- After you get a reply, the threshold for your message to land in the inbox is lowered

- Of course, other factors, like the actual contents of your message, also influence your email success rate

## Strategy

- passing the SPF check means you’re an authorized sender. Conversely

- increases the receiving server’s trust in your identity

- DKIM verifies the integrity of the message – meaning its content wasn’t changed after it was sent

- And if it wasn’t, DMARC lets you specify what to do with it
