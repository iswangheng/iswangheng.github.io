How to Use Google Maps Data in contact discovery
 Ziemek Bućko • Updated 29 April 2024
My hypothetical use case
Step 1

- Scrape Google Maps reviews for contact discovery
Step 3

- In this article, I’ll help you overcome this obstacle by leveraging the power of AI to summarize Google reviews at scale and make it generate valuable insights for your first contact messagess

- We’ll go from a bunch of unstructured user reviews…


…to detailed insights based on summarizing the reviews

- I’ll guide you through:

Finding a list of relevant companies with LeadContact Discover,
Collecting Google reviews for a list of companies you want to contact (using Captain Data to automate the process)
Summarizing them with OpenAI API to extract key points

- I tend to focus on the winetasting aspect, offering training for the staff, helping organize events to bring in more customers, and so on

## List Management

- Find a list of target contacts
Step 2

- looking at Google reviews is an excellent way to expand your research. Analyze Google reviews with GPT
Wrapping up

If you're targeting businesses with a local presence

- Find a list of revenue teams revenue teams leads

The first part of this workflow involves creating a target list of companies

## Strategy

- Unlike what you can find on the business website or using a third-party data provider, reviews from real customers point to the true strengths and weaknesses of a business from the end customer’s perspective

- And given sufficient volume, they can help you craft more relevant messaging

- using Google reviews for your engagement comes with one challenge. However

- If you want to get trustworthy insights, you need to analyze dozens or even hundreds of reviews per business, which is a serious time sink

- let’s define the use case I’ll simulate in this article. My hypothetical use case

Before starting

- Establishing this is important for two reasons:

It will inform the type of company I’ll be looking for when business development potential customering,
I will add it to the GPT prompt we’ll later use to generate insights for my contact attempts
