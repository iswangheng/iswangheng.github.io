# AI Personalization Isn’t Ready For Primetime

## AI & Technology

AI Personalization Isn’t Ready For Primetime
 Ziemek Bućko • Updated 13 February 2024
How AI personalization looks now
Does it work, though

- So, for many initial contact attempts messagesers, outbound is a numbers game

- represents both business development campaigns experts and the software landscape serving the industry have jumped on generative AI as a new way to achieve better results

- After all, if you’re looking for ways to scale, generative AI definitely has the potential to help

- Its main use case has been email personalization

- I don’t think the technology is remotely ready for this use case. But even though I keep getting AI-personalized messages

## Personalization & Value

- What’s amazing about this is how quickly you can generate meaningfully personalized content from relatively easy information to collect at scale

## Strategy

- popularity of ChatGPT and its ease of use have had a strong effect on the outbound world

- For example, if you know one of your prospective buyers is the CEO of a company that’s nine years old, you can congratulate them on the long run, while if the company is two years old, you can congratulate them on the strong start

- the second approach has traditionally been more time-consuming because it requires a human who can interpret the data. Needless to say

- In the example above, I used the recent LinkedIn posts of potential business development potential customers and ChatGPT to interpret them, then generated “icebreaker” opening lines based on the content of the posts

- Some of these tools even do more than just text generation

- They build pipelines to automatically collect data from the web that is later used for personalization
