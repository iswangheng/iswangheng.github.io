# 6 Lessons From Running 8 Company Retreats in 7 Countries

## AI & Technology

- Here are our main learnings from doing retreats over the last three years

- We are still working on getting better, but we love our current format and can’t wait to go on to our next retreat

- Norway
Collaboration by default

Falling back to “regular” work is easy. Brainstorming time in Oslo

- we sit down together and do a pair coding session. Every time a development needs to be done

- Company retreat in Spain
Finding a great home is critical

We end up spending the vast majority of our time in the house

- Most places on Airbnb are too small for a team to work all day efficiently

## Personalization & Value

- But the real value is to give everyone a better understanding of how other teammates work — those insights make remote collaboration a lot easier

Collaboration by default
Finding a great home is critical
Location doesn’t matter
Plan meals
Spend time together
Sit down for one-on-ones

Three times a year, our five-people team meets somewhere in Europe

- After having worked remotely for months, this is the perfect time for collaboration and bringing everyone up to date

- What makes a great company retreat

- Because of this, more than once, we finished a company retreat regretting not having collaborated more

- We found that the best way to ensure collaboration is to overdo it

- We plan discussions on the major projects of the next few months every day after lunch
