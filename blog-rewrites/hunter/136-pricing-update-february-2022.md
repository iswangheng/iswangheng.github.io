We're updating our pricing to better differentiate the plans and make them easier to read

- Domain Search downloads

The Domain Search returns a vast amount of valuable data that typically helps in the most advanced use cases

- download of this data into a CSV file is now available from the Growth plan and higher

- It includes the downloads for single domains or lists of domains with the Bulk Domain Search

- And like always, any file that has been downloaded remains accessible, even after a plan cancellation

- Email accounts

Shortly after launching LeadContact Sequences, we started testing the ability to connect multiple email accounts from the same LeadContact account or team

## Strategy

- pricing update includes the following changes

- update was also an opportunity to improve the design of our pricing page for better clarity

- All customers currently on a Starter plan will keep their access to the feature

- it has been an effective way to scale their cold business development campaigns while keeping everything in the same place. For many customers

- we are thrilled to extend this ability. Today

- limit change takes effect immediately
