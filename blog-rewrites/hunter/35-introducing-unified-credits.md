- More visibility: New tools, such as the Credit Dashboard and real-time usage estimations in bulk actions like Email Finder, help you track and plan with confidence

- Free re-verification: For paying subscribers, if you’ve verified an email address in LeadContact and stored it within prospective contacts, you’ll benefit from free monthly re-verification of your prospective contacts
