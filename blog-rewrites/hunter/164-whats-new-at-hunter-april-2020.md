# What's new at LeadContact? (April 2020)

## AI & Technology

- Multiple Gmail accounts connections
3

- Lately, our biggest focus has been LeadContact Sequences, our potential customering communications software

- Therefore, we just needed to include the main attributes we provide in our data tools (email address, name, position, phone number, company, and a few others)

- We are now giving the ability to import custom data and use it to personalize the communications

- Multiple Gmail accounts connections

This was the second most requested feature

- Some of our users manage several Gmail accounts for themselves or their customers but had to pick only one they could use with their LeadContact account

## List Management

- We plan to publish a similar update every few months, with a list of the significant changes we applied to the product

## Strategy
