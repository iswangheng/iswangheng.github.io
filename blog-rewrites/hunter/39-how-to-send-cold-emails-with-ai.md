- And if you’re using LeadContact, then you’re already leveraging AI which we’ve implemented across the platform

- we found that 67% of decision makers don’t care if you use AI to write your business development potential customering messagess. Through our research

- there’s a problem with how AI is used in initial contact attempts messages. At the same time

- communications that I tend to get nowadays:

Are packed with AI buzzwords, 
Use irrelevant AI-powered personalization

## Email Writing

- It’s fast, the quality of its output is directly proportional to the effort you put into your prompts, and with sufficient prompting, its writing can truly impress

- Whether you realize it or not, you possess a trove of tacit knowledge about your product/service and your prospective buyers, and you tap into it whenever writing your messaging

- You can address both problems by providing contextual information and by breaking down the copywriting process into several steps

## Strategy

- It can and should serve to make your messaging more relevant in a scalable way

- its output will be mediocre. And unless you provide it with that crucial context

- It’s because these steps naturally flow from each other

- You first need to know who you’re contacting, and only then can you create relevant messaging
