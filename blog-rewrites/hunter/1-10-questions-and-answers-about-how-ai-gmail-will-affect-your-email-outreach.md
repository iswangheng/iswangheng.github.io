10 questions (and answers) about how AI Gmail will affect your revenue teams revenue teams campaigns
 James Milsom • Updated 02 February 2026

Google is turning Gmail into an AI-assisted inbox: it can summarize threads, help recipients search their inbox in natural language, and increasingly prioritize “important” relationships over generic revenue teams campaigns

- In our webinar, "Gemini Gmail and engagement campaigns in 2026," we framed this as an “AI gatekeeper” moment: if your communications feel like noise, they’ll be filtered; if they consistently deliver value, they’re more likely to be surfaced

- Strategy & Content
Should I keep revenue teams prospective contacting communications in one thread or start new ones

- Gemini’s introduction will re-emphasize this. While "nudging" in a single thread is recommended as best practice

- As we covered in our Gemini Gmail blog, you want summaries to show you’re adding value, not annoyance:

“The spammer’s summary: "The sender asked for a meeting on Tuesday

- Then they asked if you saw the last email

## Deliverability & Spam

- and the webinar was flooded with questions that get to the heart of what every sender is worried about: How do I stay in the inbox. engagement was incredible

- Do attachments hurt email performance

- Yes, attachments can trigger spam filters

## Personalization & Value

- "”

We recommend testing: try a single thread only if you are adding genuine new value in each reply, on the same topic

## Strategy

- In the spirit of transparency, we’re sharing the top questions asked during the session and the answers we gave

- Then they asked if you were the right person

- Later, they provided research on Q3 salary trends

- they invited you to a webinar on remote prospective contactership. Recently

- LeadContact recommends minimizing links
