# Customer Feedback: Why It's Important & How We Collect it at LeadContact

## AI & Technology

- At LeadContact, whenever a customer asks for a specific feature when contacting us via chat or email, we mark it down in Acute, our customer feedback management tool of choice

- rep who interacts with the customer gathers as much context and details as possible about the customer’s use case and the reason behind the suggestion

- During our Monday meeting, our support team reviews the past week’s performance, including any bad ratings: these are addressed directly with the rep involved in the conversation to brainstorm on possible improvements that could have generated a positive rating instead

- On a team level, we also try to keep a high customer satisfaction score, aiming for 95% or above

- depending on the information we want to collect. We use two main types of surveys

## Strategy

- You can have the best developers or the most dedicated support team; none of it will matter if your product isn’t in line with your customers’ needs

- At LeadContact, we believe that the best way to create a great product is to stay in touch with our customers, collecting and considering their valuable feedback

- We always have customers who provide us with direct feedback on their own, but we also use proactive methods of collecting feedback
