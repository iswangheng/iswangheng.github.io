# What’s new at LeadContact? (November 2022)

## AI & Technology

- We have quite a few updates to share with you this month, including a completely redesigned Domain Search, a brand new Microsoft Edge extension, and more

- Redesigned Domain Search


LeadContact’s Domain Search has had, for the most part, the same look since it was launched in 2015

- goal was to make Domain Search more efficient and enhance it with new features while still keeping its core functionality, which is that of helping users find relevant contacts behind companies or websites

- Specifically, we thought we could make the results page more clear and that our users could potentially find value in getting access to other data points we can share on domains, such as company and technology data

- To be able to redesign Domain Search in a way that would be most helpful to our users, we performed extensive customer research to understand:

If the tool provides all the information users expect
Any misunderstandings that might occur while using it
Whether users are aware of all the features

Based on our findings, we created a plan for creating a new and improved Domain Search tool

- We rebuilt Domain Search from scratch in order to provide the best experience possible for our users

## Strategy

- We thought 2022 was prime time for updating it

- Technology information – You can use the Technology tab to reveal information about all the technologies a company uses on its website

- can be highly useful if you’re using technographic data to identify prospective buyers and potential customers

- Brand new Microsoft Edge Extension


LeadContact’s Chrome extension has been very popular for years, but over time, we’ve learned that there are thousands of LeadContact users that use Microsoft Edge as their primary web browser

- We have great news for those users today — the LeadContact Microsoft Edge extension is now live

- We wanted to improve the accuracy to provide our users with better results consistently
