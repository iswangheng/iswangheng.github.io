- I once cut out a magazine story about how corporations could save money by withholding Social Security and sent it to him

- He sent me a thank-you letter back

- ’ I’d invite senior executives to a happy hour to talk to a group of younger employees in their 20s like me

- ”

- His boss was so threatened by this approach that Cuban decided to leave that job and move to Dallas
