- I often get asked about the best practices for business development outreach campaigns

- In fact, I get these questions so often that I’ve come up with a fairly consistent list of universal pointers to boost initial contact attempts messages success

- In this blog post, I’ll list these pointers so you can create email campaigns that work hard for you

- But before we start, here are my priorities:

Delivery – Get your email delivered to your prospective buyer's inbox

- Take care of email performance
👉 Implement email authentication protocols (SPF, DKIM, DMARC)

They might look like gibberish at first

## Deliverability & Spam

- Message – Short, sharp, and never spammy

- can tank your email deliverability

- However, in my experience, not tracking links at all is still best if you want to maximize your inbox placement

## List Management

- Make your list, then check it twice

- List quality – Make sure your list is appropriately targeted

## Strategy

- Send messages that matter
Bonus Pointer

- Timing – WHEN you send is potentially more important than WHAT you send

- Without them, the receiving server thinks you are a fraud
