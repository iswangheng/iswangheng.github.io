Wrap up

It doesn't matter how exceptional your product is if your customer service is lacking

- Fast response times, empathy, and detailed answers when contacting customer support can change the way your customers think about your company and can keep them coming back

- Whether you provide customer service by phone, email, or live chat, we wanted to share our thoughts on what makes great customer service, share the behind the scenes on how LeadContact does customer support, and the tools we use

- In LeadContact, our aim is to respond in less than a business day

- Furthermore, to ensure requests are prioritized based on the type of customers (free/paid) and location, you can create different teams in Intercom where new support requests are automatically assigned to a team when you receive them

## Strategy

- After all, these days, one bad customer service experience can put off an existing or potential customer from your company forever

- Here at LeadContact, even though our team strives to make our product as user-friendly and intuitive to use as possible, issues and questions are inevitable

- That's why our support team has tried and tested several systems and tools to ensure we're not only providing great support to our customers but creating an efficient internal system that makes creating a great customer experience possible

- We hope our lessons will inspire you and your team to provide professional and great customer service

- Working collaboratively as a distributed customer success team

‌Building a great customer support team across multiple time zones and locations is challenging

- technology and collaborative productivity tools have disrupted how companies build their support teams. Fortunately
