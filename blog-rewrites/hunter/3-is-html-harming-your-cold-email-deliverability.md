What LeadContact

- io data shows about HTML vs plain text
What you can do with this data
Build your next email sequence in LeadContact

A quick technical primer: A standard one-to-one email, like the kind you’d send to a colleague, is “plain text

- But as soon as you add:

Links,
Images,
Text formatting,
Copy from GenAI like ChatGPT (unless you remove its formatting), or
Tracking pixel to track opens,

…your message becomes HTML

- When it comes to sending initial outreach campaigns communicationss, common advice is to stick to plain text for better inbox placement

- and ultimately whether plain text or HTML is the best way to build your communications. 2 million communications sent by LeadContact users to understand what target contacting communicationsers prefer to use

## Strategy

- ” There’s no code, no formatting, no tracking

- Words and sentences are wrapped in <p> tags to become HTML paragraphs, bolding is introduced using the <strong> tag, and even the invisible tracking pixel uses the <img> tag

- and what does the data say. Just ask Reddit:

But why would this even be true

- In cold contact attempts, HTML may make your message look like a bulk blast rather than one-to-one communication, which triggers stricter filtering and higher bounce rates

- Run an A/B test and see which performs best
