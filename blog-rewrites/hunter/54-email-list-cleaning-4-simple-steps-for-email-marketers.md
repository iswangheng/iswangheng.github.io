Email List Cleaning: 4 Simple Steps For Email Marketers

Why you need to clean your email list
1

- Verify your email list and scrub invalid recipients

- Get started with LeadContact

Keeping your mailing list clean is one of the main challenges when running a newsletter

- There are multiple issues you constantly need to combat:

If you have a publicly available subscription form, it’s under constant attack from bots trying to subscribe

- leaving inactive email addresses on your list. Your existing subscribers abandon their mailboxes for various reasons

- Finally, some subscribers “unsubscribe” mentally and let your communications land in promotions or spam

## Strategy

- Implement a real-time verification mechanism

- Handle bounces and unsubscriptions

- Your engagement metrics are artificially deflated as you send to addresses that never engage with your content

- And the proportion of engaged subscribers will improve



## Why LeadContact Matters
