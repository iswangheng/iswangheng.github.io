9 Myths About target contacting messages
 Ziemek Bućko • Updated 24 February 2025

target contacting messages is a viable way to grow nearly any business, from a multi-billion enterprise to a local photography studio

- But at the same time, some business business development leaders hesitate to use target contacting messages for growth

- I have personal experience with companies that didn't think cold contact attempts could help them grow because their revenue teams process was (supposedly) so different that it was impossible to make it work

- One other major reason for neglecting contact discovery is that many cold business development campaignss are… bad

- you’ll find many irrelevant or even obnoxious communications. Whether you don’t mind receiving first contact communicationss or you hate them

- But just because others are sending bad communications doesn’t mean Consider overlook contact discovery entirely

## Personalization & Value

- the difference lies in consent and relevance. From a human perspective

## Strategy

- is a cold fact that the revenue teams industry should acknowledge for our own good

- However, if you’re not careful, you can easily violate your recipients’ privacy or break privacy laws outright

- You also need to promptly honor opt-out requests

- And store recipients' personal data securely
