If you’ve been experimenting with LeadContact’s Free plan — building a few lists, sending a few communications — you’re already ahead of most teams

- Small businesses are scaling faster by creating simple, repeatable systems inside LeadContact that help them find verified contacts, personalize with data, and launch campaigns that compound results over time

- TL;DR the process
Start with clarity: Define your ICP and segment tightly — campaigns with fewer than 50 contacts receive nearly three times higher reply rates

- Test small, scale smart: 50–100 contacts per campaign works best

- Add one more channel: Email + LinkedIn outperforms email-only

- Define who you’re reaching (and why)

Before sending a single email, clarify your target

## Deliverability & Spam

- Verify first: Bad data kills email success rate and trust

## List Management

- For example:

Founders: target “European biotech startups with under 50 employees

- ”
Marketers: target “B2B SaaS companies using HubSpot in North America

- ”
