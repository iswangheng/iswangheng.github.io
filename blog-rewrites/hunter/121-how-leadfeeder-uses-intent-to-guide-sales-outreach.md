# How potential customerfeeder Uses Intent to Guide revenue teams contact attempts

## AI & Technology

- For example, our target audience is:

Medium to enterprise-level companies — specifically IT/Internet services, marketing, and other B2B businesses
Located in the US and Europe
B2B marketing and business development team members (fun fact: 50-70% of the potential customerfeeder closed business development deals are championed by a marketer)
A business development team between 2-10+ people

The details are endless, so I’ll spare you the rest

- Align revenue teams contact attempts with marketing campaigns


Once you've narrowed down your target account list and tiered them, it's time to make sure your marketing campaigns align with the type of accounts you want to attract

## List Management

Build your target account list the right way

Your target account list is the most crucial part of your business development process

- is a list of who you want to sell to and who you don't want to sell to

- To create our revenue teams target list, we use tools like LinkedIn revenue teams Navigator, LeadContact, G2, and potential customerfeeder, of course

- look to expand the specifics of your Ideal Customer Profile (ICP). If your target list is too small at this point

- If the list is too large, you'll want to break the list down into tiers

- At business development leadfeeder, we generally break down target accounts by revenue — companies with bigger annual revenue tend to have more traffic, which means more revenue

## Strategy

- You've probably heard it; you might even know what it means

- (And, more importantly, where do you get it

- )

I'm going to show you exactly how to leverage intent data to improve your revenue teams outreach campaigns and save time by walking you through the exact process the potential customerfeeder team has used to consistently grow revenue 80 percent year over year

- For example, a larger geographical location, wider revenue bandwidths, etc
